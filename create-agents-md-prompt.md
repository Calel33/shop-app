Create a comprehensive AGENTS.md file for the Starter.diy project that provides AI agents with all the necessary information to work effectively with this Next.js SaaS starter kit. The file should follow the structure from the agentshow.md example while incorporating the specific rules and guidelines from the project's system files.

# Instructions
Generate an AGENTS.md file that combines the structure from the agentshow.md example with the specific rules and guidelines from system.md, designsystem.md, and AGENT-MODE.md. The file should be placed at the root of the repository and provide comprehensive guidance for AI agents working on this project. rules can be found in @.cursor/rules/

## Sub-categories
- Follow the structure outlined in agentshow.md
- Incorporate all rules from system.md, designsystem.md, and AGENT-MODE.md
- Organize content in a clear, hierarchical manner
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Include specific examples relevant to the Starter.diy project

# Context
The Starter.diy project is an elite Next.js SaaS starter kit that combines Next.js 15, Convex, Clerk, and Clerk Billing. Key information sources:
- agentshow.md: Provides the basic structure and content guidelines for AGENTS.md
- system.md: Contains comprehensive rules for editing, code structure, design principles, and behavior
- designsystem.md: Specifies UI implementation requirements using design system tokens
- AGENT-MODE.md: Defines the agent mode system and protocols
- Project structure: Shows the organization of components, pages, and utilities

# Planning and Verification
- Extract key sections from agentshow.md to form the basic structure
- Incorporate relevant rules from system.md, designsystem.md, and AGENT-MODE.md
- Add project-specific information about Starter.diy
- Include build, test, and deployment commands
- Add security considerations specific to authentication and payment processing
- Verify all important rules and guidelines are included

# Output Format
Generate a complete AGENTS.md file in markdown format with the following sections:
1. Project Overview
2. Environment & Repo Basics
3. Dev Rules & Code Conventions
4. Agent Mode System
5. Build / Run / Lint / Dev Servers
6. Data & APIs
7. Git & Safety
8. Quick References

# Verbosity
Provide detailed, specific instructions rather than generic guidelines. Include concrete examples, file paths, and commands relevant to the Starter.diy project. Use bullet points for lists and maintain a professional yet accessible tone.

# Stop Conditions
Complete when the AGENTS.md file contains all necessary information for an AI agent to work effectively with the Starter.diy project, including all rules from the referenced system files and project-specific guidance.

# Persistence
Ensure the AGENTS.md file is comprehensive and self-contained. At each step, verify that the content accurately reflects the actual implementation, rules, and requirements of the Starter.diy project.
