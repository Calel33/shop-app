Frontend-First Execution Plan
ðŸŽ¯ Core Principle
Build the entire user interface first with mock data, then connect to real backend services incrementally.

Phase 1: UI Foundation & Static Prototype (Week 1-2)
Goal: Create a fully functional-looking UI with no backend dependencies.

âœ… Frontend Tasks
Setup Design System

Configure Tailwind v4 with all color tokens

Build component library with shadcn/ui

Create layout components (header, navigation, cards)

Build Static Pages (with hardcoded data)

Landing page (/) with search hero

Category pages (/categories/restaurants) with sample businesses

Business detail pages (/business/sample-cafe) with all UI elements

All pages fully functional with mock data

Implement Client-Side Interactions

Search and filter logic (client-side only)

Mapbox GL JS integration with sample coordinates

Category switching and dynamic forms

All animations and transitions

Create Mock Data Structure

typescript
// lib/mockData.ts
const mockBusinesses = [{
  id: '1',
  name: 'Sample Restaurant',
  category: 'restaurant',
  status: 'verified',
  // ... all fields from schema
}]
ðŸ”§ Deliverable
A completely functional-looking website that users can interact with, but all data is hardcoded.

Phase 2: Authentication & Basic State (Week 3)
Goal: Add Clerk auth without blocking UI development.

âœ… Frontend Tasks
Integrate Clerk

Add Sign In/Sign Up components to static pages

Implement protected route wrappers

Build basic dashboard shell (/dashboard)

Client-Side State Management

Implement mock "add business" flow (stores in localStorage)

Build admin verification UI (with mock pending businesses)

Create client-side form validation

Progressive Enhancement

All features still work with mock data

Auth provides enhanced experience

Users can "pretend" to submit businesses

ðŸ”§ Deliverable
Website with working authentication and client-side state management. Still no real backend.

Phase 3: Incremental Backend Connection (Week 4)
Goal: Start replacing mock data with real backend, one feature at a time.

âœ… Integration Tasks
Setup Convex Basics

Define schema (but keep mock data as fallback)

Create basic queries for public business data

Keep all mock data active during transition

Feature-by-Feature Migration

First: Replace public business listings with Convex data

Second: Add real business submission (keep mock as fallback)

Third: Implement admin verification with real data

Error Boundaries & Fallbacks

If Convex fails, silently fall back to mock data

Users never see broken states

Progressive enhancement principle

ðŸ”§ Deliverable
Hybrid system: real backend data where available, mock data as fallback.

Phase 4: Real Data Transition (Week 5)
Goal: Fully transition to real backend once all UI is proven.

âœ… Migration Tasks
Remove Mock Data Dependencies

Replace all mock data calls with Convex queries

Implement proper error states (instead of mock fallbacks)

Add loading states for all async operations

Real Business Flows

Actual business creation with Convex mutations

Real admin verification workflow

Live view counting and analytics

Performance Optimization

Implement proper loading states

Add skeleton screens

Optimize image loading

ðŸ”§ Deliverable
Fully functional production application with real data.

Phase 5: Polish & Launch (Week 6)
Goal: Final touches and deployment.

âœ… Final Tasks
Testing & Refinement

User testing with real workflows

Cross-browser testing

Mobile responsiveness verification

SEO & Performance

Meta tags and OpenGraph

Performance optimizations

Accessibility audit

Deployment

Vercel deployment

Domain configuration

Analytics setup

ðŸŽ¯ Key Frontend-First Benefits
No Blockers: UI team can work independently of backend

Early User Testing: Real user feedback from day one

Proven UX: Validate all interactions before backend investment

Faster Iteration: Change UI without coordinating with backend

Confident Integration: Know exactly what data you need

ðŸ”„ Development Workflow
text
Day 1-2: Build landing page with mock data
Day 3-4: Build category pages with mock data  
Day 5-6: Build business detail pages with mock data
Day 7-8: Add search/filter with client-side logic
Day 9-10: Integrate Mapbox with sample data
Day 11-14: Add auth and dashboard UI
Week 3: Start incremental backend connection
ðŸ›  Mock Data Strategy
typescript
// lib/data.ts
export const useBusinesses = () => {
  // Start with mock data
  const mockData = getMockBusinesses();
  
  // Gradually replace with real data
  const realData = useQuery(api.businesses.get) || mockData;
  
  return realData;
};
This approach ensures you have a working, testable product at every single stage of development, and you're never blocked by backend complexity.

Is this more aligned with the frontend-first approach you wanted?
