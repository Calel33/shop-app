 # User Personas — Local Business Directory (Belize)
 
 Date: 2025-10-23
 
 ## Public (Visitor)
 - Goals: Quickly find relevant nearby businesses; view hours, contact, and directions.
 - Pain Points: Outdated info, poor mobile UX, scattered sources.
- Key Tasks: Browse featured categories/businesses on the homepage, keyword/category search with location filter; open detail pages; optionally switch to map view for spatial exploration.
 - Success: Finds a suitable business within a few interactions on mobile.
 
 ## Business Owner
 - Goals: Get listed fast; keep info accurate; reach local customers.
 - Pain Points: Complex submission processes; slow approvals; lack of control.
 - Key Tasks: Create/edit listing, set precise map location, upload photos, set hours, submit for approval.
 - Success: Listing approved within SLA; accurate data visible on map and detail page.
 
 ## Admin
 - Goals: Maintain data quality; approve valid listings quickly; manage categories/tags.
 - Pain Points: Manual review workload; inconsistent submissions.
 - Key Tasks: Review/approve/reject submissions, edit listings, manage categories, (later) handle flags.
 - Success: Efficient approval flow with clear status and minimal back-and-forth.

## Implementation Note
- Mock-data-first for all personas’ primary flows (homepage discovery, listing detail, owner submission, admin approval); integrate Convex/Mapbox after UI validation.
