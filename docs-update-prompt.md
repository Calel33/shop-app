# Role and Objective
Create comprehensive documentation updates for the docs/core directory of the Starter.diy project, transforming placeholder content into detailed, accurate documentation that reflects the current state of the Next.js SaaS starter kit.

# Instructions
Update all files in the docs/core directory with specific information about the Starter.diy project based on the provided project files. Use only the information available in the project files (README.md, package.json, convex/schema.ts, etc.) and make reasonable inferences where necessary. For each file, replace placeholder content with detailed, accurate information while maintaining the existing structure and formatting.

## Sub-categories
- Maintain the existing markdown structure and formatting in each file
- Preserve all section headers and their order
- Replace bracketed placeholders [ ] with actual content
- Keep the "Last updated" date at the bottom of each file
- Use emojis consistently with the existing style
- Ensure technical accuracy based on the actual project implementation

# Context
The Starter.diy project is an elite Next.js SaaS starter kit that combines Next.js 15, Convex, Clerk, and Clerk Billing. Key information sources:
- README.md: Contains comprehensive project overview, features, tech stack, and architecture
- package.json: Lists all dependencies and scripts
- convex/schema.ts: Defines the database schema
- Project structure: Shows the organization of components, pages, and utilities

# Planning and Verification
- Examine each file in docs/core to understand its current structure and placeholders
- Extract relevant information from project files for each documentation section
- Update PRODUCT_BRIEF.md with product overview, objectives, target audience, features, and roadmap
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md with technology stack, system components, data flow, and deployment details
- Update remaining core documentation files with appropriate information
- Verify all technical details match the actual implementation

# Output Format
For each file in docs/core directory, provide the complete updated content in markdown format. Maintain the existing file structure, section headers, and formatting style while replacing placeholder content with specific information about the Starter.diy project.

# Verbosity
Provide detailed, comprehensive content for each section. Include specific technologies, features, and implementation details rather than generic descriptions. Use bullet points for lists and maintain a professional yet accessible tone.

# Stop Conditions
Complete when all files in docs/core directory have been updated with specific, accurate information about the Starter.diy project. Do not add new sections or significantly alter the existing structure of the documentation files.

# Persistence
Ensure all placeholder content is replaced with meaningful information. At each step, verify that the updated content accurately reflects the actual implementation and features of the Starter.diy project.
